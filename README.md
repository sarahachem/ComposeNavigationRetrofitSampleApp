This is a sample app to showcase compose and navigation with retrofit. The app uses dog ceo api.

There is a short demo video to have a quick look at the app.

Features: 
- List all dog breeds
- Expand breed to show subbreed if available
- Show random breed/subbreed images on breed/subbreed click
- Swipe to refresh random images

- tests are available to make sure we can properly parse the data returned by the api, and the viewmodel methods.
- Compose previews are available to test the UI components in each relevant class.

Next: 
Use compose navigation instead of graph navigation.

Just download the app and compile! but make sure you have Android Api 28+
Enjoy!
